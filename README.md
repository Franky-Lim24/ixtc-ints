# Internship Programme with SP IXTC

A repository of all the projects I have developed during my internship with SP TIE - IXTC. My role as a web developer in the VR development company exposes me to different technologies avalaible out there. I am now aware of WebGL (Unity) technology as well as WebVR (Aframe). My experience here had allowed me to taste and feel of my "end-game dream" which is to build a service or tool that will be globally-used and beneficial to developers and consumers alike.
